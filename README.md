When outlining a planning strategy for completing this SPA, prioritizing completion of the authentication early helped give me plenty of time to work slowly through the process of crafting the game board, adding the necessary on click functionality to it and getting those actions to successfully interact with the API. One of the biggest challenges I personally ran into completing this project was figuring out how to initially bind specific spaces on the game board to a corresponding index in the a game-board array. After trying different targeting methods through JQuery on different css tags (IDs and data attributes) without reaching success, I started to realize that my errors were arising due to lapses in consistency and ultimately trying to fix them became much more of a trial than I had initially anticipated it would be. I started to get disheartened early on in the process, knowing there were many more challenges in implementing features that I would surely have even more trouble on after this. However, with help from the members of my team and advice and brief snippets of input from instructors and colleagues, I realized that the best way to remedy feeling stuck with a certain feature is to get outside of your own headspace a bit and found the solution. Without such helpful advice from my colleagues at General Assembly, it would have taken me twice as long to complete this project, and I'm incredibly grateful to them for helping keep me focused and encouraged throughout this journey.

Future potential tweaks to the project:
-The first priority would be to revamp the CSS on the site and add some more pop and pizazz to it. Specifically reaching to give it it's own particular theme.
-Beyond that would be adding a feature that would allow registered players to find other registered players and add them to a friend's list. From there, options for spectating their game or challenging them to a head to head match would be deeper down the list of stretch goals.
